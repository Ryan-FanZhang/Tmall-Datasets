This dataset is taken from Alibaba TianChi Competition, this is a public dataset.

I am going to use this dataset to explore the three questions followed:
1. Order conversion rate
2. Time (days) trend of order details (more specific details)
3. Distribution of the number of orders on the map

Description of 7 fileds follow:
1. Order ID: The ID of order
2. Total_Price: the total amount of the order
3. Actual_Pay: total amount-payment amount (in the case of payment). The amount is 0 (in case of unpaid)
4. Address: Receiving address
5. Odert_Time: The time of the order is created 
6. Pay_Time: The time of payment
7. Refund: the amount applied for after payment. If no payment has been made, the refund amount is 0
